# Welcome to MRML - The Model Railway Markup Language

MRML (pronounced "murmel") is designed to express how various parts of a model railway link together in an easy to read format for both humans and machines

If you'd like to learn more about how you can easily express your layout in similar terms to YAML, please read the docs in the `/docs` folder.
