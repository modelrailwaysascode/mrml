# Layout

A layout is the "container" of the tracks.  

It has a name and optionally *may* contain metadata to improve the understanding of the layout

An example layout with some metadata could look as follows:

```yaml
---
layout:
  name: My first layout
  tracks:
    < multiple track elements >
  metadata:
    description: This is my first layout
```
